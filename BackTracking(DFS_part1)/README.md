# MazeGen 
MazeGen is a small app done by using Pygame. The original idea is to create a demo for deploying something for a depth-first search algorithm. But I thought 
generating a maze would be cool, so I did a little bit of reading about how mazes can be generated by a computer. The algorithm for this one is done by applying
the backtracking algorithm to traverse all cells in a 2D grid. The algorithm itself only takes less than 50 lines. The majority part in this code is animating
the procedures.

## Basic Requirement
Pygame module is required. You can use [pip3 install pygame] to install the module. And I think that's all you need.
